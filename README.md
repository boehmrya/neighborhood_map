# Udacity Project 5: Neighborhood Map
This project pulls in 10 art, science and history museums in the Washington D.C. area from the Foursquare API, and pulls in a corresponding wikipedia article for each location.  The museum's location appears on a google map, and its name, address and relevant wikipedia article are included in a pop-up window and listed in the sidebar.  The user can filter the list of museums in the sidebar by using the category filter.

## Usage
Place the directory on a web server (either local or remote), and navigate to index.html.
All dependences are referenced within the source code, so the user does not have to install
any additional software.

## Dependencies
* Knockout.js
* jQuery
